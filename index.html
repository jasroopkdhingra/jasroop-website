<p style="color:white;">I'm Jasroop. I'm a 3rd-year CS student at Boston College, spending all my time exploring new ideas. I spent the summer building a video game with friends as a part of <a href="https://buildspace.so/" target="_blank">buildspace</a>. Previously, I was at <a href="https://www.boston.gov/government/cabinets/boston-public-health-commission" target="_blank">Boston Public Health Commission</a>.</p>

<p style="color:white;">I have a lot of fun using my hands to build stuff, like rugs, 3D printing, etc. You name it. I do a lot of this as a part of the <a href="https://design-innovation.bc.edu/makerspaces/" target="_blank">Hatchery team</a>.</p>

<p style="color:white;">My main hobby is walking. It's pretty fun. Try it out :)</p>
